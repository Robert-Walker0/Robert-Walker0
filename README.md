# Hi, I'm Robert 👋 - A Junior Developer Based in California
I build practical tools and small applications using **C++, Lua, and Python**, with a strong focus on clean design, problem solving, and continuous improvement.

I enjoy building software from the ground up, thinking through design, implementing features, and automating tests to ensure quality. Recently, I implemented full automated testing in my Triangle Calculator project, one of my favorites because it represents my growth in writing more reliable ode.

I’m currently building experience toward becoming a software engineer or game developer, and I’m open to internships, open-source collaboration, and junior developer roles.

Skills: C++, Lua, Python, HTML/CSS, Git
